# StatEcoNet
StatEcoNet: Statistical Ecology Neural Networks for Species Distribution Modeling [Seo et al., AAAI 2021]

##### * All the results published in the AAAI-2021 paper are in "StatEcoNet/AAAI21" folder. Those results can be generated by runing '*AAAI21_main_results.ipynb*' for the results in the main paper and '*AAAI21_supplement.ipynb*' for the results in the supplement.

##### * Our experiment setup requires the same number of surveys (nVisits) per site for the simplicity of learning the model. However, the models can also be used with datasets with different numbers of surveys (visits) across sites. We provide a function of learning StatEcoNet with multiple Ks (nVisits) in '*StatEcoNet_Multi_Ks.ipynb*'. For OD-BRT, you can specify *index* variable accordingly.

## Run StatEcoNet/OD-LR/OD-1NN (under StatEcoNet folder)

* The model predicitons (e.g., occupancy, detection, and observation probabilites) will be saved in the "output/prediction" folder.

* The model evaluation metrics (e.g., AUC, Pearson correlation coefficient) will be saved in the "output" folder.

### with synthetic datasets 

Run *2.NN_Testing.ipynb* Jupyter notebook

- nSites = [100, 1000]
- nVisits = [3, 10]
- rho = [0, 1]  (0: linear relationships, 1: nonlinear relationships)
- model = [0, 1, 2]  (0: OD-LR, 1: OD-1NN, 2: StatEcoNet)

### with bird species datasets

Run *4.NN_Testing_Birds.ipynb* Jupyter notebook

- species = 	[
		"Eurasian Collared-Dove",
                "Common Yellowthroat",
                "Pacific Wren",
                "Song Sparrow",
                "Western Meadowlark"
		]
- test.fold = [1, 2, 3]
- model = [0, 1, 2]  (0: OD-LR, 1: OD-1NN, 2: StatEcoNet)

## Run OD-BRT (under OD-BRT folder)

### with synthetic datasets 
```
source("run_syn.R")
runSynthetic(nSites=100,nVisits=3,rho=0)
```
- nSites = 100 or 1000
- nVisits = 3 or 10
- rho = 0 or 1 for linear or nonlinear relationships, respectively

### with bird species datasets
```
source("run_birds.R")
runBirdData("Pacific Wren", test.fold=1)
```
- List of available species names	
  1. Common Yellowthroat
  2. Eurasian Collared-Dove
  3. Pacific Wren
  4. Song Sparrow
  5. Western Meadowlark
- test.fold = 1, 2, or 3
